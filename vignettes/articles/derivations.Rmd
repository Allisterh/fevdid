# Vector Autoregression (VAR)

Assume a VAR(p) process with the following form:

$$
A(L) X_t = \upsilon_t
$$

where 

- $X_t$ is an $N \times 1$ vector of the data

- $A(L)$ is a matrix polynomial with the lag operator, $L$

- $\upsilon_t$ is a vector of residuals, i.e. reduced-form shocks

- $p$ represents the number of lags of the data included in the VAR

- $E[\upsilon_t \upsilon_t'] = \Sigma$, so $\Sigma$ is the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals

with the lag matrix having the following structure:

$$
A(L) \equiv \sum_{T=0}^{p} A_T L^T
\\
A(0) = A_0 = I
$$

# Structural shocks

Assume there is a linear mapping, $S$, between $v_t$ and some independent structural shocks, $\epsilon_t$.

$$
\upsilon_t = S \epsilon_t
$$

with $E[\epsilon_t \epsilon_t'] = I$.

It is convenient to represent $S$ as a rotation of the Choleskey decomposition, $\tilde{S}$, of $\Sigma$.
$$
S = \tilde{S}Q
$$
where $Q$ is an orthonormal matrix ($Q^{-1} = Q'$) so that it represents a rotation.

There are infinitely many possible rotations $Q$ to satisfy the linear mapping.
Taking $Q = I$ uses the Choleskey decomposition for identification and relies upon the ordering of the variables.
Sign restriction identification involes drawing many possible matrices $Q$ and keeping only the set that have the required signs on impact.
The Angeletos, Collard, and Dellas (2020) paper and this package instead identify the $Q$ matrix that leads to one structural shock explaining the largest portion of the forecast error variance for a targetted variable, either in the time or frequency domain.

# Moving Average (Wold) Representation

The moving average representation of the VAR is given by

$$
X_t = B(L) \upsilon_t
$$

where $B(L) = A(L)^{-1} = \sum_{T=0}^{\infty}B_TL^T$ and is an infinite matrix polynomial.

With this, it is easy to rewrite our model as

$$
X_t = C(L) Q \epsilon_t = \Gamma(L) \epsilon_t
$$

where $C(L) = = \sum_{T=0}^{\infty}C_TL^T$ with $C_T \equiv B_T \tilde{S}$ and 
$\Gamma(L) = = \sum_{T=0}^{\infty}\Gamma_TL^T$ with $\Gamma_T \equiv B_T \tilde{S} Q$.
